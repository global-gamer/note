# Phase 4 – Closed Beta / Soft Launch

**Ziele:** 60–80 Testmember onboarden, Event-Zyklus stabilisieren, Support & Ticketing unter Last validieren.

## Key Workstreams
- Invite-Only Campaign (Waiting List + Referral Codes) → Discord Slots füllen.
- Ticket Tool produktiv inkl. Website-Formular-Bridge, SLA-Reporting.
- Zwei größere Signature-Events (z. B. Friday Fun Night, Ladder Kickoff).
- Game Server Loadtest (node01) mit 30+ Concurrency + failover drills.

## Economic Focus
- Kosten/Nutzer analysieren; Break-even-Szenarien für node02.
- Start Supporter Guild Pre-Sales (Founders Packs, Early VIP) zur Kosten-Dämpfung.

## Check / KPIs
- ≥70 aktive Member, 2 Signature-Events ≥25 Teilnehmer.
- Ticket-SLA < 12h, 90 % Zufriedenheit (Ticket Feedback Form).
- Node01 Loadtest stable, Monitoring Alerts <2 false positives/Woche.
